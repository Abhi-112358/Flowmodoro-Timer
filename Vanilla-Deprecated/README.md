# Flowmodoro-Timer

To Launch, go to https://abhi-112358.github.io/Flowmodoro-Timer/
Click Start. After you are done with you focus session, click stop, and click start again to start the break.

A spin off of the traditional Pomodoro Technique, Flowmodoro lets you work for however long you would like, and calculate a custom break time based on the time you spent 
focusing.


Future Plans:
-Store user data in database
-Implement login system
