# Flowmodoro-Timer
IN PROGRESS:

A spin off of the traditional Pomodoro Technique, Flowmodoro lets you work for however long you would like, and calculate a custom break time based on the time you spent 
focusing.


To Do:
-Improve the graphical interface
-Make buttons more clear indicating when a break or focus period occurs
-Track sessions
-Store user data
