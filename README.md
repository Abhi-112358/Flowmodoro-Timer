# Flowmodoro-Timer

To Launch, go to https://flowmodoro-ashy.vercel.app/


Click Start. After you are done with your focus session, click stop, and click start again to start the break/

A spin-off of the traditional Pomodoro Technique, Flowmodoro lets you work for however long you would like, and calculate a custom break time based on the time you spent 
focusing.


After migrating this project from Vanilla Js + HTML/CSS to React.js + Node.js/Express.js + MongoDB, you are able to sign in or create an account with Google Sign-in. After signing in, your timer history data is stored in the database and updates the page with the most recent 10 rounds
